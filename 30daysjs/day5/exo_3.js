// The following is an array of 10 students ages:

const ages = [19, 22, 19, 24, 20, 25, 26, 24, 25, 24]

// Sort the array and find the min and max age
const sortedAge = ages.sort()

console.log(sortedAge);

// Find the median age(one middle item or two middle items divided by two)
// can be done

// Find the average age(all items divided by number of items)
// can be done

// Find the range of the ages(max minus min)
// can be done

// Compare the value of (min - average) and (max - average), use abs() method 1.Slice the first ten countries from the countries array
// can be done

// Find the middle country(ies) in the countries array
// can be done

// Divide the countries array into two equal arrays if it is even. If countries array is not even , one more country for the first half.
// can be done
